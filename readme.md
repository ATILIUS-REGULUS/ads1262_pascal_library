### Comments
The configuration uses AIN0 and AINCOM for the input signals. Please note that this configuration expects that the input signals are differential inputs which are not coupled to a potential of the ADC, e.g. a coil.
The AINCOM input is then coupled by VBIAS mode to a level shift voltage : VBIAS = (AVDD + AVSS) / 2.<br />
This source code was developed for a seismometer project.<br />
